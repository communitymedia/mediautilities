/**
 * The item information box provides extra information about selected items, including symbolic ('file') names. It may
 * optionally occur, but if it does, it must be interpreted, as item protection or content encoding may have changed the
 * format of the data in the item. If both content encoding and protection are indicated for an item, a reader should
 * first un-protect the item, and then decode the item's content encoding. If more control is needed, an IPMP sequence
 * code may be used.
 * 
 * This box contains an array of entries, and each entry is formatted as a box. This array is sorted by increasing item
 * ID in the entry records.
 * 
 * Two versions of the item info entry are defined. Version 1 includes additional information to version 0 as specified
 * by an extension type. For instance, it shall be used with extension type 'fdel' for items that are referenced by the
 * file partition box ('fpar'), which is defined for source file partitionings and applies to file delivery
 * transmissions.
 * 
 * If no extension is desired, the box may terminate without the extension type field and the extension; if, in
 * addition, content encoding is not desired, that field also may be absent and the box terminate before it.
