 * objects in the scene description use this ID to refer to their object descriptor. An optional URL String indicates
 * that the actual object descriptor resides at a remote location.
 * 
 * The second part is a set of optional descriptors that support the inclusion if future extensions as well as the
 * transport of private data in a backward compatible way.
 * 
 * The third part consists of a list of <code>ESDescriptors</code>, each providing parameters for a single elementary
 * stream that relates to the media object as well as an optional set of object content information descriptors.
