/**
 * This box contains a compact version of a table that allows indexing from decoding time to sample number. Other tables
 * give sample sizes and pointers, from the sample number. Each entry in the table gives the number of consecutive
 * samples with the same time delta, and the delta of those samples. By adding the deltas a complete time-to-sample map
 * may be built. The Decoding Time to Sample Box contains decode time delta's: DT(n+1) = DT(n) + STTS(n) where STTS(n)
 * is the (uncompressed) table entry for sample n. The sample entries are ordered by decoding time stamps; therefore the
 * deltas are all non-negative. The DT axis has a zero origin; DT(i) = SUM(for j=0 to i-1 of delta(j)), and the sum of
 * all deltas gives the length of the media in the track (not mapped to the overall timescale, and not considering any
 * edit list). The Edit List Box provides the initial CT value if it is non-empty (non-zero).
