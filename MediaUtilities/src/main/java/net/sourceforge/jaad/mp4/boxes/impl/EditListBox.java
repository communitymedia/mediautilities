 * media time-line, or by indicating 'empty' time, or by defining a 'dwell', where a single time-point in the media is
 * held for a period.
 * 
 * Starting offsets for tracks (streams) are represented by an initial empty edit. For example, to play a track from its
 * start for 30 seconds, but at 10 seconds into the presentation, we have the following edit list:
 * 
 * [0]: Segment-duration = 10 seconds Media-Time = -1 Media-Rate = 1
 * 
 * [1]: Segment-duration = 30 seconds (could be the length of the whole track) Media-Time = 0 seconds Media-Rate = 1
