/**
 * The IPMPInfoBox contains IPMP Descriptors which document the protection applied to the stream.
 * 
 * The IPMP Descriptor is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-1. This is a part of the MPEG-4 object descriptors (OD) that describe
 * how an object can be accessed and decoded. In the ISO Base Media File Format, IPMP Descriptor can be carried directly
 * in IPMPInfoBox without the need for OD stream.
 * 
 * The presence of IPMP Descriptor in this IPMPInfoBox indicates the associated media stream is protected by the IPMP
 * Tool described in the IPMP Descriptor.
 * 
 * Each IPMP Descriptor has an IPMP-toolID, which identifies the required IPMP tool for protection. An independent
 * registration authority (RA) is used so any party can register its own IPMP Tool and identify this without collisions.
 * 
 * The IPMP Descriptor carries IPMP information for one or more IPMP Tool instances, it includes but not limited to IPMP
 * Rights Data, IPMP Key Data, Tool Configuration Data, etc.
 * 
 * More than one IPMP Descriptors can be carried in this IPMPInfoBox if this media stream is protected by more than one
 * IPMP Tools.
