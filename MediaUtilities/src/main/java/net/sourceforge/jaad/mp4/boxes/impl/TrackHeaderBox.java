/**
 * This box specifies the characteristics of a single track. Exactly one Track Header Box is contained in a track. In
 * the absence of an edit list, the presentation of a track starts at the beginning of the overall presentation. An
 * empty edit is used to offset the start time of a track. If in a presentation all tracks have neither trackInMovie nor
 * trackInPreview set, then all tracks shall be treated as if both flags were set on all tracks. Hint tracks should not
 * have the track header flags set, so that they are ignored for local playback and preview. The width and height in the
 * track header are measured on a notional 'square' (uniform) grid. Track video data is normalized to these dimensions
 * (logically) before any transformation or placement caused by a layup or composition system. Track (and movie)
 * matrices, if used, also operate in this uniformly-scaled space.
