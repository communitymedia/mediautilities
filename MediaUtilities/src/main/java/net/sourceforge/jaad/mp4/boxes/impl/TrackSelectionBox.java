/**
 * A typical presentation stored in a file contains one alternate group per media type: one for video, one for audio,
 * etc. Such a file may include several video tracks, although, at any point in time, only one of them should be played
 * or streamed. This is achieved by assigning all video tracks to the same alternate group. (See subclause 8.3.2 for the
 * definition of alternate groups.)
 * 
 * All tracks in an alternate group are candidates for media selection, but it may not make sense to switch between some
 * of those tracks during a session. One may for instance allow switching between video tracks at different bitrates and
 * keep frame size but not allow switching between tracks of different frame size. In the same manner it may be
 * desirable to enable selection - but not switching - between tracks of different video codecs or different audio
 * languages.
 * 
 * The distinction between tracks for selection and switching is addressed by assigning tracks to switch groups in
 * addition to alternate groups. One alternate group may contain one or more switch groups. All tracks in an alternate
 * group are candidates for media selection, while tracks in a switch group are also available for switching during a
 * session. Different switch groups represent different operation points, such as different frame size, high/low
 * quality, etc.
 * 
 * For the case of non-scalable bitstreams, several tracks may be included in a switch group. The same also applies to
 * non-layered scalable bitstreams, such as traditional AVC streams.
 * 
 * By labelling tracks with attributes it is possible to characterize them. Each track can be labelled with a list of
 * attributes which can be used to describe tracks in a particular switch group or differentiate tracks that belong to
 * different switch groups.
