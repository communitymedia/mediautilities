/**
 * The FD session group box is optional, although it is mandatory for files containing more than one FD hint track. It
 * contains a list of sessions as well as all file groups and hint tracks that belong to each session. An FD session
 * sends simultaneously over all FD hint tracks (channels) that are listed in the FD session group box for a particular
 * FD session.
 * 
 * Only one session group should be processed at any time. The first listed hint track in a session group specifies the
 * base channel. If the server has no preference between the session groups, the default choice should be the first
 * session group. The group IDs of all file groups containing the files referenced by the hint tracks shall be included
 * in the list of file groups. The file group IDs can in turn be translated into file group names (using the group ID to
 * name box) that can be included by the server in FDTs.
